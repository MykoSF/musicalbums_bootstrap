                <p class="card-text">"Awaken, My Love!" is the third studio album by American recording artist Donald
                  Glover, under his stage name Childish Gambino. It was released by Glassnote Records on December 2,
                  2016. Consisting of tracks being sung rather than rapped, its fusion of psychedelic soul, funk and
                  R&B
                  influences was considered a bold departure from the predominantly hip hop style of his prior work.
                  The
                  album was produced by Glover and his longtime collaborator, Ludwig Göransson.</p>
